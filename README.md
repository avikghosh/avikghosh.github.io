## Welcome to avikghosh.github.io

Hi There! I am Avik Ghosh, currently working as Senior QA Engineer at [bankbazaar.com](https://www.bankbazaar.com).

### appium-gradle-demo [View on Github](https://github.com/avikghosh/appium-gradle-demo)
This is a simple demo of using appium for Android Test Automation. I have used Java, TestNG and Gradle, Android Emulator for this demo.

This demo test opens up the Android default dialer application and then clicks on the Add Favorite link. Then it verifies that Empty Contacts message. (_Assuming you have no contacts in your emulator_)


Assuming you have appium and an Android Emulator running, you clone this repo and run the demo with the following steps

```bash
cd path/to/project
./gradlew clean build
```
